Chitter Challenge
=================



What is Chitter?
-------

For the fifth weekend challenge at Maker's Academy, we have been asked to build a full-stack application that simulates the core functionality of Twitter. A publicly visibly feed will display all 'peeps' from users, who in turn can sign up, post 'peeps', log in and log out of the app.

How to use Chitter:
-------

```
Open Terminal
Navigate to a directory where you would like this repo to be stored
enter the following:
$ git clone git@github.com:annalaise/chitter-challenge.git

Then use bundler to install the Gems. Make sure you have the latest version of the Gems
by running `bundle update` as a last step.
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle
$ bundle update

```

Alternatively, visit the app on Heroku here: https://annalaise-chitter.herokuapp.com/
